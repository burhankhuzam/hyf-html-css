- Research how to create a hidden file and how to display it using ls command.

Create Single hidden file: touch .file1.txt
Create multiple hidden files: touch .file1.txt .file2.txt .file3.txt
Display hidden file: ls -a

- Research how to create multiple nested directories with one mkdir command. E.g.
How would you create 'fun' directory along with all directories in the path below: /c/Users/unmesh/these/folders/are/just/for/fun.

Create multiple nested directories: mkdir -p c/Users/unmesh/these/folders/are/just/for/fun


- Execute following commands terminal:

echo "test" > fun
echo "another test" >> fun
wc -c fun

Verify number of characters in the file:  wc fun= 1 2 13 fun


- Research how to append something in the file *WITHOUT* a newline character.

E.g. echo "test" > fun
echo "another test" >> fun
cat fun
Output of "cat fun" is
test
another test
- How would you use echo command, so that output would be: testanother test?
echo "testanother test" > fun
